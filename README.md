## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate frontend developer with 2.4 years of corporate experience. My expertise lies in the React framework, along with proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have successfully worked on Microfrontend Architecture to optimize existing applications within my organization.

I am well-versed in version control with Git, continuous integration and deployment using Jenkins, and container orchestration with Kubernetes. My experience includes handling deployments and resolving server issues.

Beyond my 9-5 responsibilities, I am committed to continuous learning and skill enhancement. I actively work on personal projects, experimenting with new technologies and implementing them in my applications. I am driven by curiosity and a deep interest in understanding the "why" and "how" behind every piece of logic I encounter.
