## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate DevOps and Frontend Engineer with 3+ years of experience in automating deployments, managing incidents, and configuring cloud
infrastructure. Skilled in Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and React.js. Experienced in building scalable applications and delivering
responsive user interfaces.

I am well-versed in version control with Git, continuous integration and deployment using Jenkins, and container orchestration with Kubernetes. My experience includes handling deployments and resolving server issues.

Beyond my 9-5 responsibilities, I am committed to continuous learning and skill enhancement. I actively work on personal projects, experimenting with new technologies and implementing them in my applications. I am driven by curiosity and a deep interest in understanding the "why" and "how" behind every piece of logic I encounter.
